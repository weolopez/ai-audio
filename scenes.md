This revised plan provides a clear emotional journey across three different customer scenarios. Each beginning scene establishes a specific customer emotion and problem, and each ending scene provides a unique resolution, some happy and one disappointing, to keep the dialogue interesting.

Does this revised plan work for you? We can now move on to scripting the dialogues based on this framework.







Great now create the 6 scripts so I can send them to google ai studio for creating the audio or to generate video with VEO 3


Great. Based on the detailed plan, here are the six scripts for your AT&T service call scenarios. Each script is ready to be used with a text-to-speech or video-generation AI model.

Scene 1: The Angry Customer
Characters:

JAY: An AT&T technician. Calm, professional, and knowledgeable.

MARTHA: The customer. In her 50s, visibly angry.

Setting: The front porch of a suburban home.

(The sound of a doorbell ringing. MARTHA opens the door, looking stressed and angry. JAY stands on the porch, holding a tablet.)

JAY: Hi there, I'm Jay with AT&T. Here for the service call. You must be Martha?

MARTHA: (Sighs, crosses her arms) Finally! You guys said someone would be here yesterday. This is the third time I've had to take a day off work for this. My internet has been cutting out for weeks. I can't even get through a video call without it dropping. What is so difficult about a stable internet connection?

JAY: I understand your frustration, Martha. I've read the notes from your previous calls. It seems like the issue is a bit complex, but I'm here to get a hands-on look at the wiring and try to pinpoint the source of the problem.

MARTHA: "A bit complex." That's what the last technician said. Look, I just need this to be fixed. I don't care what it takes, I just want it to work. Please tell me you're not going to leave without solving it this time.

JAY: My goal is to get your service working again. Let's start by checking the main line and the connection point inside.

(Jay enters the house, and Martha follows, still looking frustrated. The scene ends.)

Scene 2: The Confused Customer
Characters:

JAY: An AT&T technician. Patient and reassuring.

MR. HENDERSON: The customer. In his 70s, nervous and confused.

Setting: The front porch of a modest home.

(The sound of a doorbell ringing. MR. HENDERSON slowly opens the door, peering out with a worried expression. He holds a cordless phone in his hand.)

JAY: Good morning, sir. I'm Jay with AT&T. I'm here about your landline issue. Are you Mr. Henderson?

MR. HENDERSON: (Nods, voice is a little shaky) Yes, that's me. My phone… it's been silent for two days. No dial tone. I can’t call my daughter. She lives out of state, you know. I’m starting to worry. Is it broken? Is it something I did?

JAY: No, sir, I'm sure it's nothing you did. It's likely an issue with the line outside. It happens sometimes, a little wear and tear over the years. I can assure you that we're going to get this sorted out for you. Your phone is a lifeline, I know.

MR. HENDERSON: Oh, thank you. I just... I was afraid you'd say I need to get a whole new line or something. I don't know how to do any of that computer stuff. I just need it to ring so my girl can call me.

JAY: Don't you worry about a thing. Let's just step inside, and I'll take a look at the wiring. I'm confident we can have you talking to your daughter again in no time.

(Jay enters the house with a reassuring smile, and Mr. Henderson follows, a little less worried. The scene ends.)

Scene 3: The Relieved Customer
Characters:

JAY: An AT&T technician. Friendly and professional.

RACHEL: The customer. In her 30s, excited and relieved.

Setting: The front porch of a new-looking townhome.

(A loud knock on the door. RACHEL opens it quickly, a wide smile on her face.)

RACHEL: You're here! Thank goodness! Come on in, please. I'm Rachel. I've been waiting all morning.

JAY: It's nice to meet you, Rachel. I'm Jay. I'm here to install your new fiber optic service.

RACHEL: (Almost bounces on her toes) Yes! I'm so excited. Our old internet was so slow. I was always buffering during my work video calls. We're getting the new smart home system, and I need the high-speed connection to run everything.

JAY: You're going to be very happy with the speed of the new fiber network. It's a huge upgrade. I've got all the equipment right here. So, where's the best place for me to set up the modem?

RACHEL: I cleared a space for you right in the living room. Just tell me what you need me to do, and I'll do it. I just want this to be as fast as possible. I'm already planning a huge movie night to test it out!

JAY: Sounds like a great plan. I'll get started right away.

(Jay and Rachel enter the house, and the scene ends on a positive note.)

Scene 4: The Disappointing Resolution
Characters:

JAY: An AT&T technician. Sympathetic.

MARTHA: The customer. Disappointed and resigned.

Setting: Martha’s living room, a few hours later.

(Jay is holding his tablet and shaking his head. Martha is sitting on her couch, looking deflated.)

JAY: I'm so sorry, Martha. I've checked everything—the line to the house, the modem, all the connections. Everything on our end is perfectly fine. The issue seems to be a larger network problem in your specific area.

MARTHA: (Sighs, defeated) So... it’s not fixed?

JAY: Not completely. I've logged the issue and escalated it to our network team. They'll need to work on it from the central office. I've put a "high priority" tag on it, so hopefully, it'll be resolved in the next day or two.

MARTHA: So I have to wait again?

JAY: I know this isn't the news you wanted to hear. Believe me, I wish I could fix it right here for you. But this is a bigger issue than a simple on-site repair. I'll make sure to note that you’ve been extremely patient.

MARTHA: (Shakes her head) Patient? I'm exhausted. I just... I guess I'll just wait. Thanks for trying, anyway.

(Jay gives a sympathetic nod, packs his things, and leaves. Martha sits alone, looking at her non-working modem. The scene ends.)

Scene 5: The Heartwarming Resolution
Characters:

JAY: An AT&T technician. Happy and proud.

MR. HENDERSON: The customer. Overjoyed.

Setting: Mr. Henderson's living room, a short time later.

(Mr. Henderson is on the phone, a wide smile on his face. Jay is packing up his tools.)

MR. HENDERSON: (On the phone) Sarah! Yes, it's me. The phone is working! The nice young man fixed it. He's an angel. I'll call you back in a little while, dear. I love you, too.

(He hangs up the phone and turns to Jay, his eyes welling up with tears.)

MR. HENDERSON: (Voice cracking with emotion) Thank you. You have no idea what this means. She was starting to get worried. We talk every day.

JAY: I'm really glad I could help, sir. The connection was just a bit loose on the box outside. It was a simple fix.

MR. HENDERSON: Simple to you, a miracle to me. You’re a very good man, Jay. This job you do… it’s important.

JAY: Thank you, Mr. Henderson. It was a pleasure to help you. Now you can talk to your daughter as much as you'd like.

(Mr. Henderson beams and shakes Jay's hand warmly. The scene ends.)

Scene 6: The Exciting Resolution
Characters:

JAY: An AT&T technician. Accomplished and friendly.

RACHEL: The customer. Enthusiastic and thrilled.

Setting: Rachel's living room, a few hours later.

(Rachel is standing in front of her TV, a movie is streaming in perfect 4K. She has a huge smile on her face. Jay is finishing his paperwork.)

RACHEL: Wow. Just... wow. I can’t believe how fast this is. The TV loaded in a second, and my laptop is flying. My husband is going to be so happy when he gets home. No more buffering!

JAY: That's the power of fiber. I've run a speed test and everything looks perfect. You're getting the speeds you signed up for. The Wi-Fi signal is strong all throughout the house.

RACHEL: This is just a game-changer for us. Seriously, thank you so much. You were so quick and professional. You made this whole process so easy.

JAY: I'm glad I could help. Just give us a call if you have any questions, but you should be good to go. Enjoy your movie night!

(Rachel turns back to her TV, excitedly getting a bag of popcorn. Jay smiles, collects his things, and leaves. The scene ends with a sense of triumph and a positive new beginning.)
